# Chatbot

This is a simple chatbot project created by @Pablofr73 and @ADPR2. The chatbot uses pre-defined phrases to respond to user input. It is written in Python and currently runs in the console, but we plan to add a graphical interface in the future.

## Getting started

To run the chatbot, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. Follow these steps to set up and run the chatbot:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

>> git clone https://github.com/Pablofr73/chatbot.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

>> cd chatbot

3. Install the required dependencies (if any):

>> pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the chatbot:

>> python chatbot.py

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the chatbot.

## Future plans

We have several plans for future improvements to the chatbot, including:

- Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
- Expanding the chatbot's vocabulary and capabilities.
- Implementing more advanced features, such as natural language processing and dialogue management.
